# ‚è∞ OneUSGAutomaticClock ‚è∞
## CURRENT STATUS: WORKING ‚úÖ
This is a little script for Georgia Tech students to be able to automatically clock hours without worrying about forgetting to turn it off.

It can be easily modified to work for any university in the USG system 
(If you have any questions on how to do this, feel free to reach out, I can make a fork that works for any of the universities). 

## Requirements (what does the script use?):
- Python 3.9+ [Find Here](https://www.python.org)
- selenium [Find Here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/)
- chromedriver_autoinstaller [Find Here](https://pypi.org/project/chromedriver-autoinstaller/)

1. Open a terminal window.
1. Type the following to clone the repo and switch to the project directory
    * `git clone https://github.com/Shaun-Regenbaum/OneUSGAutomaticClock.git && cd OneUSGAutomaticClock`

1. Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    * **Make sure to install Python 3.9 or Later**
1. Once you have python type the following to install the needed dependencies:
    * `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Finally, run the script from the command line, then sit back and relax (while doing your work):

## Help and Contact Info:
I know that getting code up and running can be very frustrating üòìüòñ, so please if you have any problems with python or cloning the repo (or anything else) reach out to me at shaunregenbaum@gmail.com or leave an issue üòéüòÅ!
If you have any others questions at all, please reach out!

## Note: 
If you want to get the chromedriver manually, or are having problems, you can download the appropriate chromedriver for your OS from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home). You will need to manually add this driver to your environment path and and modify the code to correctly reference it [as such](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started).
