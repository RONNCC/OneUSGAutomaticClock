# OneUSGAutomaticClock (updated 12-22-20)
This is a little script for Georgia Tech students to be able to automatically clock hours without worrying about forgetting to turn it off .

It can be easily modified to work for any university in the USG system 
(If you have any questions on how to do this, feel free to reach out, I can make a fork that works for any of the universities). 

You need Python 2.7+ (or 3), selenium, and the chromedriver (provided in the repo) needs to be in your system path.

Otherwise, simply clone the repo, fill out the details in the script for yourself and run the clock_manager.py file and it'll work!

You will need to confirm on duo 2fa one time (they dont have an API sadly).

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
